# ‚ö° VoltSight: Intelligent Electricity Demand Forecasting Dashboard

VoltSight is a web-based interactive dashboard that predicts electricity demand using machine learning models. It provides visual analytics, model comparisons, and insights into seasonal and weather-related demand patterns, making it ideal for energy analysts, researchers, and smart grid operators.

## üîç Features

- üìà **Forecasting Panel**  
  Forecast electricity demand for selected cities and dates using multiple ML models.

- üß™ **Model Comparison**  
  Evaluate and compare model performance (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) with visual plots and metrics.

- üß† **Feature Importance**  
  Interpret key predictors using model-specific feature importance analysis.

- üìä **Demand Analysis**  
  Analyze how demand changes with temperature, time of day, weather, and season.

- üî¨ **Cluster Analysis**  
  Use KMeans clustering and PCA to explore demand patterns across different dimensions.

- üíæ **Export Options**  
  Download predictions and analysis results in CSV format.

## üì¶ Dataset

This project uses electricity demand and weather data from the following Kaggle dataset:

üîó [US Top 10 Cities - Electricity and Weather Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamkulkarni01/us-top-10-cities-electricity-and-weather-data?select=EIA930_BALANCE_2018_Jul_Dec.csv)  
Provided by **Shubham Kulkarni** on Kaggle. The dataset includes hourly electricity demand and weather conditions for 10 major US cities.

> Ensure you download and preprocess the dataset using the `preprocessing.ipynb` notebook before training models.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mxneeb/VoltSight-Electricity-Demand-Forecasting
cd VoltSight-Electricity-Demand-Forecasting
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> To generate `requirements.txt` from your environment:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Preprocessing

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook to clean and engineer the raw dataset:

```bash
jupyter notebook preprocessing.ipynb
```

This will generate a cleaned dataset named `preprocessed_data2.csv`, required for training.

### 4. Train Models

```bash
python predictive_modeling.py
```

This will:
- Load the cleaned dataset (`preprocessed_data2.csv`)
- Train global and city-specific machine learning models
- Save them to the `models/` directory

### 5. Launch the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run frontend.py
```

This will start the **VoltSight** interactive dashboard in your browser.
